The gallery is just a simple HTML page where each character is displayed with their name printed below, and where you can
scroll to see all characters. Clicking any of the character's portrait will have their name read out loud.

Made for my 3-year old son Harry, who kept asking me for the names of the Mario characters, and where I constantly had
to look them up on the internet. Now he can do that himself on the iPad, even without internet!
